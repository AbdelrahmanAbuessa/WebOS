JavaScript OS is an Operating System Based Solely on JavaScript, Throught this Operating System, you will be able to experience installing an Operating System like no other (jk),
and you will get the chance to mess around with some of the best (non-existent) features that this Operating System has to offer.

Some of the Features and Software available in this Operating System:

1- Command Prompt (CMD): You ever wanted to feel like one of those hackers in movies, well say no more, this command prompt lets you control your system anyway you want, eventually, just 
type in a command in the hidden input field and you'll get to see wonders:

ProTip: write "install jsOS" and hit enter to start the system installation process.

After going through the installation process that will remind you of the good old days when everything was peaceful and quiet, you will be directed to the setup page where you will get 
to set your VERY IMPORTANT USERNAME, so that we cna greet you everytime you use our system, and the not so noticable password that if you forget, you might never be able to access our system ever again

2- THE DESKTOP:
the desktop is where you can unleash all your imagination, with a grid that is capable of holding 24 slots of information, 3 of which are already occupied by system apps that you can never uninstall
Pro Tip: Check the Start Menu for cool settings and to change your background.

The desktop offers A REAL TIME CLOCK, DRAWING SOFTWARE, WRITING SOFTWARE, AND A MATHEMATICS SOFTWARE.
Make sure you check out the pretty cool "save" function that unfortunately only works with the notepad...

After you are done with our system, please shut it down instantly as it might have some serious security issues (maybe)

IMPORTANT TIP: NEVER INTERRUPT THE INSTALLATION PROCESS OR YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO ACCESS OUT SYSTEM AGAIN
